# What is this repo?

Hey! This is a collection of tools and scripts I've written over the years

It now has my other tools (
[SkeletonConnector](https://github.com/CatAndDogSoup/SkeletonConnector) and 
[mGearScripts](https://github.com/CatAndDogSoup/mGearScripts)
) as submodules

It contains sets of tools for rigging, fx, rendering, and some general pipeline and macro scripts,
as well as custom shelves, icons, and a "Runner" file which will automatically set required 
environment variables, and then run Maya with this whole tool-set ready to use


# Installing

To get this whole project, as well as both submodules, run these `git` commands

```
git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules -j8 https://github.com/CatAndDogSoup/Maya_Tools.git
git submodule update --remote --merge
```
